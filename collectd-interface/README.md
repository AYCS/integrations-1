### DESCRIPTION

From [collectd wiki](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface):

The Interface plugin collects information about the traffic (octets per second), packets per second and errors of interfaces (of course number of errors during one second). If you're not interested in all interfaces but want to exclude some, or only collect information of some selected interfaces, you can select the “interesting” interfaces using the plugin's configuration.
