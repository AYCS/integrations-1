### Packets Transmitted

> Count of packets transmitted by the interface. 

You can view this metric as a Rate/sec or a cumulative count (Max).

**Rate/sec**: Provides the current traffic level on the interface in packets/sec.

**Max**: Provides the cumulative count of packets transmitted. Note that since this metric is a
cumulative counter, its value will periodically restart from zero when the 
maximum possible value of the counter is exceeded.
