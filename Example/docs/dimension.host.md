### host

> Host Dimension

This dimension is sent in with all collectd plugins. It will either be what the
host thinks its hostname is (output of hostname), or the value that has been configured
to override it in collectd.conf.  More Information can be found [here](https://support.signalfx.com/hc/en-us/articles/203773189-Recognize-collectd-metrics-in-SignalFx).
