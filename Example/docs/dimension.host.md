### host

> Host Dimension

This dimension is sent in with all collectd plugins. It will either be what the
host thinks it's hostname is (output of hostname) or what has been configured
to override it in collectd.conf.  More Information can be found [here](https://support.signalfx.com/hc/en-us/articles/203773189-Recognize-collectd-metrics-in-SignalFx).
